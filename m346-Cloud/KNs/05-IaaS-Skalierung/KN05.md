## A) Grundbegriffe und private IP wählen

### Term explanation

|Term|Explanation|
|----|-----------|
|VPCs|Stands for **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud. A VPC is logically isolated from the rest of networks in the AWS Cloud. Grants access to control over virtual network environment.|
|Subnet|A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. A subnet mask, such as 255.0.0.0 or /24, defines how many hosts can connect to this network. Subnets allow you to create custom networks that are not directly connected to the internet, enabling you to set custom rules and policies, such as firewall settings.|
|Wie viele Subnets sind bereits vordefiniert?| There is one predefined subnet with the name: '-' |
|Decken die IP Ranges des Subnets den gesamten IP Range des VPC ab?||
|Öffentliche IP Adresse| The public IP is reachable from the internet |
|Statische IP Adresse|A static IP address is an IP address that does not change. Unlike dynamic IP addresses assigned by DHCP, static IP addresses remain constant, making them useful for servers that need a consistent address for communication.|

### Steps

1. find subnet of instance from KN04 and name it ***Sub-KN04***.
2. Choose another Subnet and name it ***Sub-KN05***. (From now on create a new subnet for each KN -> You can already create the Subnets Sub-KN06 - Sub-KN10)
3. Define two private IPs in the KN's subnet.
   **Conditions:**
     - Last byte must be dividable by 10 (min: xxx.xxx.xxx.10, max: xxx.xxx.xxx.250).
     - The IPs must be in the range of the subnets subnet mask

- Screenshot of Subnet-List with customized names
- Two private IPs for apache and mariadb server. (No screenshot required, plain text is enough):
    - Apache server: 192.168.1.10
    - MariaDB server: 192.168.1.20
